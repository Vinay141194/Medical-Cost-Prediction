# Medical-Cost-Prediction

In this dataset, I have predicted the Individual medical costs billed by health insurance using features such as age, bmi, whether the person smokes or not, number of children covered by the health insurance etc. I have used linear regression, support vector regression, decision tree regression and random forest regression to predict the medical charges.
